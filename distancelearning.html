    <p>St. Paul’s University rolled out its Distance Learning Academic Programmes in September 2012 in a bid to provide a flexible, accessible and cost effective mode of learning as an alternative to the traditional classroom based programmes. This mode of study is suitable for those who find it difficult to attend brick and mortar classes either due to busy work schedules or work in far flung or marginalized places. It gives one the opportunity to study away from the classroom and does not interrupt their day to day activities.</p>

    <p>Since inception, SPU’s DL center has grown rapidly not only in number of students but also in its geographical reach. We currently provide education to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Students in Kenya</li>
        <li>Students from the wider East African Community in countries such as Southern Sudan, Uganda and Tanzania</li>
        <li>Kenyans working in other countries such as Liberia and Afghanistan</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our programmes attract students from a wide cross section of career backgrounds ranging from those in formal employment or running their own businesses to those in public leadership. Whether the learner is just starting out in their career, a senior executive or a politician they mostly have very busy schedules hence the suitability of our programmes. However it is prudent to point out that distance learning is not for everyone nor is it the easier route to a degree. It requires a high level of personal discipline, hard work and commitment since the student practically does the studies by themselves. We therefore congratulate students who choose this mode of study and most especially those who choose to study with us.</p>
    <p>The programs under the DL mode are structured into trimesters and take on average 2 & 1/2 years to complete. Each year has 3 semesters and students are allowed to take a maximum of 7 units only. The learners also get to interact with their instructors via face to face meetings twice within the Semester as well as via telephone conversations, email and Skype. It is hoped that these interactions will help the students to supplement the distance learner’s self-study.</p>
